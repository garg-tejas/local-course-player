# Local Course Player 🎥

A simple, privacy-focused course player that runs entirely in your browser. Load your local course folders containing videos and PDFs and start learning.

## Features

- **Entirely Local**: Your course files never leave your computer. Everything is processed in-browser.
- **Video & PDF Support**: Seamlessly switch between video lessons and PDF documents.
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatically saves your completed lessons for each course.
- **Distraction-Free UI**: A clean interface with a collapsible sidebar to help you focus.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigate and control video playback efficiently.

## How It Works

1.  Click **"Select Course Folder"**.
2.  Choose the root folder of your course.
3.  The player will automatically organize your lessons based on the sub-folders inside.

## Why This Exists

I built this because I wanted a simple way to watch my local courses without uploading them, losing my progress, or dealing with bloated software. It's a straightforward tool that respects your privacy and gets the job done.
